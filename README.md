# Intro TO Machine Learning
This project is my write-up of this ML Course provided by Scikit-learn: https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/index.html

It is intended as a condensed summary of the course, with worked examples of the key concepts involved. My aim is to consolidate my learning in this project so that I can refer back to it, and to add more over time (for example considering other ML libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch).

I have divided the project into notebooks covering different areas.
